Yet Another QWOPPER: helping QWOP win the 100 meters with genetic programming
written with python
=================================================================

The intended goal of the project is to write a bot able to play QWOP
(http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html), training it with genetic programming
principles.

Interaction with QWOP will be made via QWOPPER by slowfrog.
Interaction with QWOPPER and our python code will be done by JYTHON.

QWOPPER MANUAL:
Running 'ant package' in the top-level directory should produce a jar file in the dist/ directory. 
Running the jar directly will open a small UI where you can launch some runs. The simulation can also be run from the command line like 'java -cp dist/qwopper.jar com.slowfrog.qwop.ui.Main 10 5'. 
That will run five different random athletes, each one for ten tries. 
Currently, that simulation automatically stops the runner after one minute, to avoid wasting too much time on the first batch.
