Yet Another QWOPPER: helping QWOP win the 100 meters with genetic programming
written with python
=================================================================

The intended goal of the project is to write a bot able to play QWOP
(http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html), training it with genetic programming
principles.

Interaction with QWOP will be made via QWOPPER by slowfrog.
